basic structure of a C++ code:

Example:

#include <iostream> //include header file
int main () //main function, note the "int" declares that main() function returns an integer
{
  //a statement is a piece of instruction, ending with ; in C++
  //a print statement; lines start with // are comments, ignored by the compiler
  std::cout << "Hello World! "<<std::endl; //a print statement
  std::cout << "I'm a C++ program"<<std::endl; //another print statement
  //The return value for main should indicate how the program exited. Normal exit is generally represented by a 0 return value from main. Abnormal termination is usually signalled by a non-zero return but there is no standard for how non-zero codes are interpreted.
  return(0);
}
