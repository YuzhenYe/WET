C++ (/ˌsiːˌplʌsˈplʌs/ "cee plus plus") is a general-purpose programming language.

C++ is standardized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), with the latest standard version ratified and published by ISO in December 2017 as ISO/IEC 14882:2017 (informally known as C++17).

In 1979, Bjarne Stroustrup, a Danish computer scientist, began work on "C with Classes", the predecessor to C++.[9] The motivation for creating a new language originated from Stroustrup's experience in programming for his Ph.D. thesis. 

In 1983, "C with Classes" was renamed to "C++". 

In 1985, the first edition of The C++ Programming Language was released.

2011, C++11 

As of 2017, C++ remains the third most popular programming language, behind Java and C
