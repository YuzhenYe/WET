A variable is a portion of memory to store a value; 
you may consider a variable as a symbol that stores a value so you can refer to the symbol name to access the value.

Example:

int i = 10; //a variable called i is declared, and the assignment statement assigns 10 to i
cout<<" i is "<<i<<endl; //now we can access 10 by calling i 

As a programmer, you are responsible for giving your variables nice names. 
Some rules for naming your variables: 
  -- Use one or more letters, digits, or underscore characters (_). 
  -- Spaces, punctuation marks, and symbols cannot be part of a name. 
  -- Names shall always begin with a letter. 
Which of the following are legal names?
   123name, book1, num1, money, book_name, bookName


A function defines a block of statements that 
  e.g, the main() function.
Named entities, such as variables and functions need to be declared before being used in C++. 
The point in the program where this declaration happens influences its visibility.

Example 1:
for(int i = 0; i < 10; i ++)  //here i is a variable, and it is an integer
   cout<<i<<endl;

Example 2:
