# VI/VIM
## VIM (Vi IMproved) is one of the most commonly used and powerful editors these days. It is extensible and customizable and is useful for writing and editing programs in virtually any language.

## Quick start:

- Create a file for editing:  vim test.txt
- Start Insert mode:  type the "i" command
- Type some text that makes sense to you
- Back to Normal mode:  press <Esc>
- Save file and exit: type ":wq"
- Most confusing part of using vim: insert mode & normal mode (command mode)

## A little more advanced:
- Cursor movement
```
0 - jump to the start of the line
$ - jump to the end of the line
w - jump forwards to the start of a word
b - jump backwards to the start of a word
```
- Editing
```
dd - delete/cut a line
2dd - delete/cut two lines
3dd - delete/cut three lines
p - paste the clipboard after cursor
P (shift + p) - paste before cursor
r - replace
x - delete a letter
2x - delete two letters
```
