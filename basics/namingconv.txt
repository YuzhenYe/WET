E.g., MyClass.cpp, MyClass.h

E.g., Line, SavingsAccount

Variable names -- mixed case starting with lower case.
line, savingsAcount 

Named constants -- all uppercase using underscore to seperate words

Names representing methods or functions -- verbs and written in mixed case starting with lower case.
E.g., getName(), computeArea()

Names representing namespaces should be all lowercase.
