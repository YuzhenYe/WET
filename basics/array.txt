Arrays:

An array is a series of elements of the same type placed in contiguous memory locations that can be individually referenced by using index.

Example:

int nums[5] = {1, 3, 2, 50, 10, 100};

the number within [] specifies the number of items in the array, {} is used to initialize the array
the individual elements can be refered using index (starting from 0)
nums[0] (the first element, i.e., 1), nums[1] (the second element, 3), and so on.
what's the last the element?

cout << nums[0] << endl;
