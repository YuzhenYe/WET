We have seen:
for(int i = 0; i < 10; i ++)  //here i is a variable, and it is an integer
   cout<<i<<endl;

1) What's a variable
A variable is a portion of memory to store a value; 
You may consider a variable as a symbol that stores a value so you can refer to the symbol name to access the value.
It means that you don't need to know the exact location where a variable is stored; just refer to the name.

Example:
int i = 10; //a variable called i is declared, and the assignment statement assigns 10 to i
cout<<" i is "<<i<<endl; //now we can access 10 by referring to i 

There are three different ways to initialize variables:
int i = 10; //c-like initialization
int i(10); //same as i = 10; constructor initialization
int i{10}; //uniform initialization

Assignment operator (=) is just one of the operators that programmers use to work with variables.
Here are more: 
  arithmetric operators (+, -, *, /, %)
  compound assignment (+=, -=, *=, /=, %=)
        a += 1 is the same as a = a + 1 
  increment and decrement (++, --)
  rational and comparison operators (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=)
  logical operators (!, &&, ||)
  conditional ternary operator (?): condition? result1 : result2
       c = a > b ? a : b;

2) How to name your variables
As a programmer, you are responsible for giving your variables nice names. 
Some rules for naming your variables: 
  -- Use one or more letters, digits, or underscore characters (_). 
  -- Spaces, punctuation marks, and symbols cannot be part of a name. 
  -- Names shall always begin with a letter. 
  -- Don't use reserved keywords (such as int, float)
Which of the following are legal names?
   123name, book1, num1, money, book_name, bookName, int

3) Basic types (character, numerical integer for whole number, floating-point type for real value)
 char (one byte; at least 8 bits)
 int (at least 16 bits)
 long int (at least 32 bits)                 
 signed int
 unsigned int
 float (single precision, 23 bits of significand, 8 bits of exponent, and 1 sign bit)
 double (52 bits of significand, 11 bits of exponent, and 1 sign bit)
 void (no storage)
 bool (boolean type)

 bits and bytes: 
   one bit, 0/1
   one byte: 8 bits

 write a program to find out how many distinct values a 16-bit unsigned integer would be able to represent!

4) Compound types: string (we will talk more later)
   Example:
   string mymessage = "Hello World";
   cout << mymessage << endl;

5) Scope  
Named entities including variables and functions need to be declared before being used in C++. 
The point in the program where this declaration happens influences its visibility.
