# Goals: 
  1) Learning the basics of C++ (NO class & objects)
  2) Learning some basic data structures & algorithms 
  3) Starting to use http://www.usaco.org 
  4) If kids get bored, we may try to use some arduino projects; great for introducing the concepts of inputs (not just text files, can be inputs from the sensors), hardware/software interaction, and loops.
