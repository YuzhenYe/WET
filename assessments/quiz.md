## Week 3 (05/09/2018)
- Quiz: 
```
problem 1:
int a = 10;
a += 20;
cout << a << endl;

problem 2:
int sum = 0;
for(int i = 1; i < 10; i ++) 
	sum += i; 
cout << sum << endl;

problem 3.
CompareNum.cpp: this program asks users to input two numbers, 
and displays the larger one (using if-else structure).
```

## Week 4 (May 16, 2018)
- Quiz: 
```
Q1:
int a[15] = {4, 3, 5, 1, 2, 3, 67, 18, 19, 19, 21, 21, 34, 35};
what's the largest index for a? and what's a[4]?
Q2: 
MinMax.cpp, write a program, in which you declare an array of 10 integers, 
and write a loop to find and display the smallest and largest values.
```

## Week 5 (May 22, 2018)
```
Q1: 
write a statement to declare an array of 5 integers, and assign their initial values; 
write a statement to declare a string (or character sequence), which stores "hey, there".

Q2:
int guessMe(int n) 
{
	int a = 0;
	for(int i = 1; i <= n; i ++) {
		a += i;
	}
	return a;
}
int main()
{
	int b = guessMe(5);
	int c = guessMe(10);
}
Using a sentence to describe what guessMe() does; b = ?; c = ?; and now type up the code.

Q3: 
The Hamming distance between "APPLE" and "ORANG" = ?
The Hamming distance between "FISH" and "FISH" = ?
```
