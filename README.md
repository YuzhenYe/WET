# Resouces for WET gang

# Before start
  1) A Mac with xcode installed (to check: open terminal, and type g++)
  2) An account on github.com (all codes will go alive on github)

# Goals: 
  1) Learning the basics of C++ (NO class & objects)
  2) Learning some basic data structures & algorithms 
  3) Starting to use http://www.usaco.org 
  4) If kids get bored, we may try to use some arduino projects; great for introducing the concepts of inputs (not just text files, can be inputs from the sensors), hardware/software interaction, and loops.

# Main resources
  1) C++ online tutorial: http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/
  2) USA Computing Olympiad website: http://www.usaco.org
  3) Rosalind (http://rosalind.info/problems/locations/)
  4) Game Programming in C++ (http://www.jblearning.com/catalog/9781598220322/)
# Format -- weekly meetings, in-meeting exercises, take-home exercises, and perhaps arduino projects
# No fancy IDE, vim instead

# Brief schedules
Weeks 1-2. 
   1) Get to know some basic command lines (cd, ls, mkdir, rm) (https://github.com/YuzhenYe/WET/blob/master/basics/linux.txt)
   2) Get to know vim (https://github.com/YuzhenYe/WET/blob/master/basics/vim.txt)
   3) Get to know git (git clone; git add; git commit; git push)
   4) Hello World (main function) (http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/program_structure/)(https://github.com/YuzhenYe/WET/blob/master/firstCodes)
   5) Compiler (g++; source codes vs executables) (http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/introduction/)
   6) Exercises: complete the three versions of the helloWorld, and one more version of your very unique way, push them to your github repository

Week 3-4.
